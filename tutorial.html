<h1 id="daw">Choosing a DAW</h1>

<p>
Choosing a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) is something that does not affect your journey as a producer as much as beginners think. Still, many producers spend a lot of time thinking about what software to use. For a beginner, suitable choices are:

    <li>FL Studio</li>
    <li>BandLab</li>
    <li>Ableton</li>
    <li>GarageBand</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using Samples and Loops Is Not a Crime</h2>

<p>
Many producers think that from the very start they need to make everything by themselves, which is wrong. You can start by using loops as it will help you save time and help you develop other skills such as drum placement. You can get to making your own melodies later.<br><br>
So the next time you hear someone say <em>"well, I make all my melodies by myself"</em> just say sybau nerd.

If you wanna learn how to sample, watch this video I like very much:

<h2>Don't Switch</h2>

<p>
After <a href="#daw">choosing a DAW</a>, don't start thinking that switching DAWs will make you better. Every DAW has similar features. Focus on cooking, not switching kitchens.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Do you need a nice setup to start?</strong><br>
No. Start with what you have. It's enough. Don't waste your money making excuses like "I can't make songs without a setup." Kendrick made

</p>
<h2>Be Consistent</h2>
<p> When i was just starting (im still a newbie even though) I used to get lazy<br>
sometimes not consistent with my work you have to  avoid that atleast 2 hours a day is enough a break in once in a while<br>
is bearable but dont make it a habit and always be bedrotting</p>

<h2>Get Inspired</h2>
   <p>The thing that can help you a lot id getting inspired.<br>
      Analayze different kinds of beats open DAW and see what yyou can do.<br>
      This is certainly the best way to learn production.<br></p>                                                                <img src="https://blog.landr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Top-10-Best-DAW-Apps-for-Production-in-20242024Featured.png"width="300"><br>
     <p> Just look up a beat in any genre then open a DAW get different samples like drums, bass, synths, etc.<br>                                    
      At first it will feel meaningless but soon you will start picking up threads you will get an idea of what drums<br>
      of  a particular genre sound like what the 808 placements are and so on<br>
      and after some time you will be able to make those beats easily.<br>
      And trust me with this it is better than torturing yourself<br>
      to watch quintillions of videos about different genres.
