<h1>WELCOME ASPIRING PRODUCERS LIKE MYSELF</h1>

<blockquote>
    This website is created by a student under the name "Sadiatorr" who is learning beat production.
    I have made many mistakes (and still do), and I realized there are producers who are currently
    at the stage where I once struggled. This website is here to help them out.
